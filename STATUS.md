## Milestone

**v0.1 "Prove it"** — `onebin audit` for ELF, plus the far2l reference build.
Roadmap in [DESIGN-onebin.md §10](./DESIGN-onebin.md). Task list in
[00-AGENT-TASK.md §4](./00-AGENT-TASK.md).

## Tasks

| # | Task | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | repository hygiene | done |
| 1 | build skeleton, `make`, `make test`, `tests/test.h` | done |
| 2 | `util/buf` — bounds-checked reader | done |
| 3 | `util/ver` — version parsing and comparison | done |
| 4 | `tests/mkelf` — the fixture generator | done |
| 5 | `elf/image` | **next** |
| 6 | `elf/dynamic`, `elf/verneed`, `elf/symbols` | not started |
| 7 | findings, baselines, reporters | not started |
| 8 | the checks, **including Profile M** | not started |
| 9 | the CLI | not started |
| 10 | malformed corpus and fuzzer | not started |
| 11 | coverage and lint test | not started |
| 12 | self-audit and documentation | not started |
| 13 | `tools/audit.sh` learns about modules | done |
| 14 | CMake toolchain files + `zig-*` wrappers | not started |
| 15 | `tools/build-far2l.sh` + `contrib/far2l/deps.lock` | not started |
| 16 | `contrib/far2l/UPSTREAM.md` | not started |

`make test`: 26 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped. `make test-asan` and `make
test-ubsan` both clean.

`tools/audit.sh` implements the profile ladder as of Task 13, so the shell
stopgap and the C tool will agree once the C tool exists.

`src/elf/elf_const.h` exists as of Task 4 — the generator needed the constants
before the parser did. Task 5 extends it rather than starting it.

## Reference application

[far2l](https://github.com/elfmz/far2l), pinned at `v_2.8.0`. See
[04-REFERENCE-far2l.md](./04-REFERENCE-far2l.md).

| Build | Target | State |
|---|---|---|
| `far2l-tiny` (TTY, no plugins) | Profile S, Level 1 | recipe not written |
| `far2l-tty` (TTY + plugins + X11 helper) | Profile H, Level 1 | recipe not written |
| `far2l-sdl` (SDL graphical backend) | Profile H, Level 1 | recipe not written |
| `far2l-wx` (wxWidgets) | Profile H, Level 0 | expected to fail Level 1, by design |

**`far2l-sdl` is the point of the exercise.** A graphical file manager that needs
no toolkit on the target is the demonstration; the terminal builds are the easy
half. Do not let it slip to a later milestone.

## Open design questions

| # | Question | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Profile D — carry your own loader.** Profile S forbids `dlopen`, which rules out plugins, GPU and audio, i.e. most real programs. Proposal in [DESIGN-onebin.md §13](./DESIGN-onebin.md). | proposal written, **not decided**, no code |
| 2 | One file vs. one file plus modules for Profile H. Current answer: ship the modules beside the binary and say so; `onebin pack` closes the gap in v0.4. | decided for v0.1 |
| 3 | `memfd_create` + `dlopen("/proc/self/fd/N")` as a true single-file route. | open, see DESIGN §11 row 14 |

## Decisions taken since the documents were first written

- `--exclude-libs,ALL` is opt-out, not a rule — it breaks any application that
  exports an ABI to its own plugins.
- Profile M exists: modules get audited, with the executable-only checks skipped.
- Layer 3 includes the process, not just the library. Shelling out to the host's
  `7z` is correct behaviour.
- Profile order of preference is **H first, D when H cannot reach far enough
  back, S as a deliberate niche** — not "S is the ideal and H is the compromise".
- **`~/Apps` is the install location**, and Override Mode installs there rather
  than into `~/.local/share`. The recovery path for a broken self-update is "the
  user deletes a directory they can see", which only works if they can see it.
  Manifesto §7.2, `DESIGN-onebin.md` §4 and §5.7.
